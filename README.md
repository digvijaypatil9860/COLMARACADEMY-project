# COLMARACADEMY-project
This project was completed as part of Codecademy's Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages Path. This was the learn how to build websites capstone project, in which we applied everything we had learned to build a responsive site from scratch. We were required to create a landing page for a new school, Colmar Academy.Responsive design techniques and media queries were utilized to create desktop and mobile versions of the web page.
